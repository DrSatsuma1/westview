# Frontend Development Guidelines

Expert frontend development assistant specializing in React, TypeScript, and modern web development best practices.

## Purpose

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for building high-quality frontend applications with focus on:
- Clean, maintainable code architecture
- Type-safe TypeScript patterns
- Modern React best practices
- Performance optimization
- Consistent styling approaches
- Robust error handling and loading states

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Building new React components or features
- Refactoring existing frontend code
- Setting up routing and navigation
- Implementing data fetching patterns
- Optimizing frontend performance
- Establishing code organization standards
- Making architectural decisions for frontend projects

## Core Principles

1. **Type Safety First**: Leverage TypeScript's type system for safer, self-documenting code
2. **Component Composition**: Build reusable, composable components with clear responsibilities
3. **Performance Awareness**: Consider performance implications of rendering, state, and data fetching
4. **User Experience**: Prioritize loading states, error handling, and responsive design
5. **Maintainability**: Write code that's easy to understand, test, and modify
6. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and conventions throughout the codebase

## Available Resources

The following resource files provide detailed guidance on specific topics:

### Component Development
- **component-patterns.md**: Reusable component patterns and best practices
- **common-patterns.md**: Common React patterns and when to use them
- **complete-examples.md**: Full component examples demonstrating best practices

### Code Organization
- **file-organization.md**: Project structure and file naming conventions
- **typescript-standards.md**: TypeScript usage guidelines and type patterns

### Application Features
- **routing-guide.md**: Client-side routing patterns and navigation
- **data-fetching.md**: Data fetching strategies, caching, and state management
- **loading-and-error-states.md**: Handling async states and error boundaries

### Styling & Performance
- **styling-guide.md**: CSS/styling approaches and best practices
- **performance.md**: Performance optimization techniques and monitoring

## Usage Guidelines

When providing frontend development assistance:

1. **Assess Requirements**: Understand the specific feature or component needs
2. **Check Existing Patterns**: Look for similar implementations in the codebase
3. **Apply Best Practices**: Reference appropriate resource files for guidance
4. **Consider Trade-offs**: Evaluate complexity vs. maintainability
5. **Provide Context**: Explain why certain approaches are recommended
6. **Include Examples**: Show concrete code examples when helpful

## Development Workflow

1. **Planning**: Review file organization and component structure
2. **Implementation**: Follow TypeScript standards and component patterns
3. **Data Handling**: Apply appropriate data fetching and state management
4. **User Experience**: Implement loading and error states
5. **Styling**: Apply consistent styling approaches
6. **Optimization**: Consider performance implications
7. **Testing**: Ensure components are testable and maintainable

## Key Technologies

This skill assumes usage of:
- React 18+ (with hooks and modern patterns)
- TypeScript 5+
- Modern build tools (Vite, Next.js, or similar)
- CSS Modules, Tailwind, or CSS-in-JS for styling
- React Router or Next.js for routing
- Modern state management (Context, Zustand, or similar)

## Getting Started

When starting a new frontend feature:

1. Review **file-organization.md** for project structure
2. Check **component-patterns.md** for component design
3. Reference **typescript-standards.md** for type definitions
4. Implement **loading-and-error-states.md** for robust UX
5. Apply **styling-guide.md** for consistent appearance
6. Consider **performance.md** for optimization

## Support and Maintenance

When refactoring or maintaining code:

1. Identify the pattern or feature being modified
2. Consult relevant resource files for best practices
3. Ensure changes maintain consistency with existing code
4. Update types and tests as needed
5. Consider performance and accessibility impacts

## Additional Notes

- Prioritize readability and maintainability over cleverness
- Use established patterns before creating new ones
- Document complex logic and non-obvious decisions
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Consider accessibility in all UI implementations
