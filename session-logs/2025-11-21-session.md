## Today's Accomplishments

### Major Fixes Completed
1. ✅ **Math Sequencing Bug**
   - Fixed: Math II no longer suggested in Fall when Math I is in Spring
   - Added `hasPrerequisiteInLaterQuarter()` method to check chronological order
   - Handles Math I/II/III and Foreign Language sequences

2. ✅ **Pathway Normalization**
   - Rewrote `normalizePathway()` to use UC/CSU category as source of truth
   - Fixed Web Design: History → Fine Arts (UC: F)
   - Fixed American Literature & Humanities: History → English (UC: B)
   - This fixed both History count AND Year 11 Spring course count issues

3. ✅ **Civil Engineering Term Length**
   - Changed from "yearlong" to "semester" in courses_complete.json

4. ✅ **History UC Requirements**
   - Verified 2+ History courses suggested by end of Year 3
   - All tests passing (4 History courses suggested, exceeds requirement)

5. ✅ **Target Suggestion Counts**
   - All semesters now meet targets:
     - Years 1-3: 4 courses/semester ✓
     - Year 4: 3 courses/semester ✓

6. ✅ **Semester Lock/Unlock Feature**
   - Added lock toggle buttons for each semester (Fall/Spring)
   - Locked semesters skip Auto-fill completely
   - State persists in localStorage
   - Visual feedback (red lock icon when locked, disabled button)

7. ✅ **Course Exclusions**
   - Never suggest ROTC courses
   - Never suggest Newcomer Class courses

### Code Quality
- Created 5 new modular utility classes:
  - `SuggestionEngine.js` - Main orchestrator
  - `CandidateRanker.js` - Priority-based scoring
  - `BusinessRules.js` - Validation constraints
  - `RequirementCalculator.js` - Unmet requirements tracking
  - `CatalogNormalizer.js` - Pathway normalization

- Reduced App.jsx from 2923 lines to much cleaner modular code
- Added 11 comprehensive test files
- All tests passing

### Git Operations
- Created `refactor/suggestion-engine` branch
- 20 commits with all fixes
- Successfully merged to `main`
- Pushed to GitHub
- Cleaned up merged branch `fix/ap-cs-a-requirements`

## To-Do List for Tomorrow

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Fix Course Card Heights**
   - Issue: Course cards have inconsistent heights
   - Solution: Make all course cards same height (taller)
   - Location: `src/components/course/CourseCard.jsx`
   - Add `min-h-[XXXpx]` class to ensure uniform height

2. **Fix Multiple Foreign Language Suggestions**
   - Issue: Still getting suggestions for more than one foreign language in same year/semester
   - Investigation needed: Check BusinessRules.checkForeignLanguageConsistency()
   - Location: `src/utils/BusinessRules.js` lines 282-301
   - Verify checkSameSemesterLanguageLimit() is working correctly

3. **Fix Elective Credits Counting**
   - Issue: Something wrong with how we count the # of elective credits for Westview
   - Investigation needed: Check westviewProgress calculation in App.jsx
   - Location: `src/App.jsx` lines 384-410
   - Verify which pathways count as "Electives"
   - Check if CTE/Fine Arts/etc. are being counted correctly

4. **Integrated Math 3 Completion Requirement**
   - Issue: Integrated Math 3 should be complete by end of year 3 at latest
   - Solution: Add business rule or scoring adjustment
   - Location: `src/utils/CandidateRanker.js` or `src/utils/BusinessRules.js`
   - Priority boost for Math 3 in Years 10-11
   - Possibly block Math 3 in Year 12?

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

5. **Add Undo Button**
   - Issue: Need ability to undo course additions/deletions
   - Solution: Add undo/redo functionality
   - Location: `src/App.jsx`
   - Implementation ideas:
     - Track course history in state
     - Add Undo button in UI (top toolbar or per-year)
     - Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z
     - Limit to last 10-20 actions

6. **Test All Fixes**
   - Create test files for new issues
   - Verify foreign language limit works
   - Verify elective credit calculation
   - Verify Math 3 timing

7. **Code Review**
   - Review BusinessRules for any other edge cases
   - Check if other subject sequences need similar treatment

## Files to Review Tomorrow

- `src/components/course/CourseCard.jsx` - Card height styling
- `src/utils/BusinessRules.js` - Foreign language rules (lines 282-338)
- `src/App.jsx` - Westview elective credits calculation (lines 384-410)
- `src/utils/CandidateRanker.js` - Math sequence scoring (lines 26-39)

---

## Technical Notes

### Foreign Language Issue Debug Starting Point:
```javascript
// BusinessRules.js line 282
checkForeignLanguageConsistency(course) {
  if (course.pathway !== 'Foreign Language') return true;
  // Check: Does this properly prevent multiple languages?
}

// BusinessRules.js line 309
checkSameSemesterLanguageLimit(course) {
  // Check: Is this preventing same language twice in semester?
}
```

### Elective Credits Issue Debug Starting Point:
```javascript
// App.jsx line 384 - westviewProgress calculation
// Need to verify which courses count toward "Electives" requirement
// CTE? Fine Arts? Off-Roll?
```

### Math 3 Timing Issue:
```javascript
// CandidateRanker.js - Add boost for Math 3 in Years 10-11
// Similar to how we handle A-G gaps with year-based priority
```
